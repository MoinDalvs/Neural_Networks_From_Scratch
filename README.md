## Gradient Descent

### Let's talk about Differential Derivative and Partial Derivative
  To better understand the difference between the differential and derivative of a function. You need to understand the concept of a function.
  
  A function is one of the basic concepts in mathematics that defines a relationship between a set of inputs and a set of possible outputs where each input is related to one output. Where Input variables are the independent variables and the other which is output variable is the dependent variable.
  
  Take for example the statement " 'y' is a function of x i.e y=f(x) which means something related to y is directly related to x by some formula.
  
    The Calculus as a tool defines the derivative of a function as the limit of a particular kind.
### What is Differential?
It is one of the fundamentals divisions of calculus, along with integral calculus. It is a subfield of calculus that deals with infinitesimal change in some varying quantity. The world we live in is full of interrelated quantities that change periodically.

For example, the area of a circular body which changes as the radius changes or a projectile which changes with the velocity. These changing entities, in mathematical terms, are called as variables and **the rate of change of one variable with respect to another is a `derivative`**. **And the equation which represents the relationship between these variables is called a `differential equation.`**
### What is Derivative?
  The derivative of a function represents an instantaneous rate of change in the value of a dependent variable with respect to the change in value of the independent variable. **`Itâ€™s a fundamental tool of calculus which can also be interpreted as the slope of the tangent line.`** It measures how steep the graph of a function is at some given point on the graph.

    Equations which define relationship between there varibales and this derivatives are called Differential Equations.
    
    **`Differentiation is the process of finding a derivative`**
