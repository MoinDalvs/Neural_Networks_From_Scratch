## 1. Let's talk about Neural Networks<a class="anchor" id="1"></a>

	Supervised learning can be used on both structured and unstructered data. For example of a structured data let's take house prices prediction data, let's also assume the given data tells us the size and the number of bedrooms. This is what is called a well structured data, where each features, such as the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, etc has a very well defined meaning.
	
	In contrast, unstructured data refers to things like audio, raw audio, or images where you might want to recognize what's in the image or text (like object detection and OCR Optical character recognition). Here, the features might be the pixel values in an image or the individual words in a piece of text. It's not really clear what each pixel of the image represents and therefore this falls under the unstructured data.
	
	Simple machine learning algorithms work well with structured
